## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AleksPGL/podcast-search-tool.git
   cd podcast-search-tool
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your API keys**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
   ```env
   LISTEN_NOTES_API_KEY=your_listen_notes_api_key_here
   PODSCAN_API_KEY=your_podscan_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the tool**
   ```bash
   python podcast_search.py
   ```

## üîë API Keys Setup

### Listen Notes API
1. Sign up at [Listen Notes API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/)
2. Get your free API key (100 requests/month)
3. Add to your `.env` file

### Podscan API  
1. Sign up at [Podscan](https://podscan.fm/)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add to your `.env` file

> **Note:** The tool works with either API key, but having both provides the best results.

## üí¨ Natural Language Examples

Instead of structured queries, just describe what you're looking for:

```bash
üéôÔ∏è Describe what podcasts you're looking for: Find me JavaScript programming podcasts

üéôÔ∏è Describe what podcasts you're looking for: Show me true crime shows sorted alphabetically

üéôÔ∏è Describe what podcasts you're looking for: I want business podcasts about startups

üéôÔ∏è Describe what podcasts you're looking for: Comedy podcasts grouped by source

üéôÔ∏è Describe what podcasts you're looking for: Meditation and mindfulness shows
```

## üß† Smart Query Processing

The tool automatically enhances your search:

| Your Input | Enhanced Search | Why |
|------------|----------------|-----|
| "javascript podcasts" | "technology javascript programming" | Adds related tech terms |
| "true crime stories" | "crime true crime mystery" | Expands crime category |
| "business startups" | "business startup entrepreneur" | Includes entrepreneurship |
| "meditation shows" | "health meditation mindfulness" | Adds wellness context |

## üìä Sorting Options

Control how results are displayed by adding sorting terms to your query:

- **Mixed (default)** - Alternates between API sources for variety
- **Alphabetically** - Say "alphabetically" or "a to z"
- **By Host** - Say "by host" or "by publisher"  
- **By Source** - Say "by source" or "grouped by"
- **No Sorting** - Say "unsorted" or "random"

### Examples:
```bash
"javascript podcasts sorted alphabetically"
"true crime shows by host"
"business podcasts grouped by source"
```

## üéØ Sample Output

```
üéß Found 10 podcast(s) for: 'javascript programming'

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `LISTEN_NOTES_API_KEY` - Your Listen Notes API key
- `PODSCAN_API_KEY` - Your Podscan API key

### Customization
- Edit `topic_keywords` dictionary to add new categories
- Modify `results_per_source` to change API request limits
- Adjust `max_sentences` in `format_description()` for longer/shorter descriptions

## üö¶ Usage Tips

### Getting Better Results
- **Be specific**: "JavaScript React podcasts" vs "programming shows"
- **Use keywords**: Include technology names, topics, or genres
- **Try variations**: If no results, try broader or different terms
- **Sort strategically**: Use "mixed" for variety, "alphabetically" for browsing

### Troubleshooting
- **No results**: Try broader search terms or check API keys
- **Few results**: Some topics have limited podcast coverage
- **API errors**: Check internet connection and API key validity
